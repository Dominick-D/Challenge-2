# Challenge-2 Portfolio


## Description

I built this website in hopes for it to be easily upgradable in the future to catch the eyes of future employers. I learned how to add borders to the right side of the headers, create a layout for my work catagory, aswell as trouble shoot throughout.

## Usage

Use Nav links as you would a index in a book, each picture of my projects in the work section is a link to the corresponding website. click on the contact me nav links for the appropriate course of action.
